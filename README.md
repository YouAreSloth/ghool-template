# ghool-template
Hello! Thanks for using my template to make your tool.

A few things to note if you are using this template:

I just want to state that, this is a TEMPLATE, not something for you to copy.
Please make your own code, and use this how it is meant to be used, as a shell.

SO DON'T SKID!

Also, if you are using this template, make sure your tool is open-sourced, and not ratted etc.

Thanks for supporting me!
